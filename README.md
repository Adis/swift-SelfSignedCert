This is a very quickly put together fork of [swift-SelfSignedCert](https://github.com/svdo/swift-SelfSignedCert). I suggest against using it in production since I needed it for a proof-of-concept and it's unmaintained.

Additionally, I merged two dependencies in since they needed some work themselves and I didn't feel like making endless forks:

- <https://github.com/svdo/swift-SecurityExtensions>
- <https://github.com/dapperstout/swift-bytes>
